# This folder contains codes used in simulations and data analysis in the paper "Two-component Mixture 
# Model in the Presence of Covariates" by Nabarun Deb, Sujayam Saha, Adityanand Guntuboyina,
# Bodhisattva Sen (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07897). It also contains a package called NPMLEmix which
# implements all the relevant methods used in the aforementioned paper.
#
#
# The codes for data analysis can be found in the folders - AstroDataSets and NeuralData/FDRreg-master. The codes
# for simulations are available in the source folder.
#
#
# Before using the package NPMLEmix, it is recommended to go through the manual.pdf file. Note that, in order to
# use this package, you must have a Mosek license and a working version of the package Rmosek installed. To install
