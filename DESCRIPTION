Description: We develop three procedures for estimation in a two-groups model with covariates (see Scott et al 2015). One of them is a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation based approach when the signal distribution is an infinite Gaussian location mixture and the signal proportion is a logistic function of the available covariates. Two other functions - marg1() and marg2() have also been implemented for inference in the above framework. All these methods can be used for inference in multiple hypotheses testing. For a more detailed exposition, see corresponding paper: "Two-component Mixture Model in the Presence of Covariates"- Nabarun Deb, Sujayam Saha, Adityanand Guntuboyina, Bodhisattva Sen.
